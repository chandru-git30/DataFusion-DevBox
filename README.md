   cd DataFusion_DevBox/DevBox
   ```
2. **Run the Docker Container:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
3. **Go to Browser:**
   ```bash
   http://localhost:8080
   ```
## Included Technologies

- Zookeeper
- Jupyter Extensions

## Tips and Notes
- You can customize the Docker image by modifying the Dockerfile.
- Make sure to stop and remove the container when you need to recompose the image:
```bash
docker stop <your_devbox_instance>
docker rm <your_devbox_instance>
```
- Explore and experiment with the different technologies to supercharge your big data projects!

## Working
- Once you composed the docker and executed port 8080 you will prompt to a code server like this
